## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

Navigate to localhost:8080 to view the application. Ensure CORS is setup to view API responses in browser (see CORS section).

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Setup cross origin requests (CORS)

Since this is a front end only application making cross origin requests, you must first go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com and allow for cross-origin requests(CORS) to the app. Simply click on button (if one is available on the page). If not, then making API requests out to the MetaWeather API should work.
